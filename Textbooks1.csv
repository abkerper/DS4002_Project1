United States History,978-1-6903-0550-7,"John J. Newman, John M. Schmalbach",Perfection Learning,High School,"Atomic Bombs After Okinawa, a huge invasion force stood ready to attack Japan. Extremely heavy casualties were feared. By this time, however, the United States had developed a frightfully destructive new weapon. The top-secret Manhattan Project under General Leslie Groves employed over 100,000 people and spent $2 billion to develop a weapon whose power came from the splitting of the atom. J. Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, New Mexico, successfully tested the first atomic bomb on July 16, 1945. The new president, Harry Truman, and his wartime allies called on Japan to surrender unconditionally or face “utter destruction.” When Japan gave an unsatisfactory reply, Truman consulted with his advisers and decided to use the new weapon on two Japanese cities. On August 6, an A-bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and on August 9, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. About 250,000 Japanese died, either immediately or after a prolonged period of suffering, as a result of the two nuclear bombs. War and Morality Nuclear weapons, by design, destroyed a much larger area than conventional weapons. When used on population centers, the new technology would cause tens or hundreds of thousands of deaths and injuries from the blast and radiation. The moral issue of killing civilians was raised in World War I by the German use of submarines against passenger ships. In World War II, the Germans and British bombed each other’s cities based on the rationale that it would force the other side to sue for peace. Instead, research after the war concluded it did not have the desired effect. In fact, industrial output often went up because the bombing of urban centers released workers from their commercial jobs to work in well-hidden war plants. Some would argue that in modern industrialized societies, civilians were part of the war effort and therefore legitimate targets. The United States in World War II first used “strategic bombing” of only military targets; however, it began to cross the line with the fire-bombing of Japanese cities, which caused thousands of civilian deaths. Today, people recognize that large-scale nuclear warfare could end most human life, if not most life of all kinds, on Earth. Japan Surrenders Within a week after the second atomic bomb fell, Japan agreed to surrender if the Allies would allow the emperor to remain as a titular (powerless) head of state. General MacArthur received Japan’s formal surrender on September 2, 1945, in Tokyo’s harbor aboard the battleship USS Missouri. The diplomacy that led to the end of the war set the stage for the efforts to construct a more lasting peace (see Topic 7.14). "
"America's History, Volume 2: Since 1865",978-1-4576-2817-7,"James A. Henretta, Eric Hinderaker, Rebecca Edwards, Robert O. Self",Bedford/St. Martin's,High School,"Three weeks later, President Truman ordered the dropping of atomic bombs on two Japanese cities: Hiroshima on august 6 and Nagasaki on august 9. Truman’s rationale for this order—and the implications of his decision—have long been the subject of scholarly and popular debate. The principal reason was straightforward: Truman and his American advisors, including Secretary of War Henry Stimson and army Chief of Staff General George Marshall, believed that Japan’s military leaders would never surrender unless their country faced national ruin. Moreover, at the Potsdam Conference on the outskirts of Berlin in July 1945, the allies had agreed that only the “unconditional surrender” of Japan was acceptable — the same terms under which Germany and Italy had been defeated. To win such a surrender, an invasion of Japan itself seemed necessary. Stimson and Marshall told Truman that such an invasion would produce between half a million and a million allied casualties. Before giving the order to drop the atomic bomb, Truman considered other options. His military advisors rejected the most obvious alternative: a nonlethal demonstration of the bomb’s awesome power, perhaps on a remote Pacific island. If the demonstration failed — not out of the question, as the bomb had been tested only once — it would embolden Japan further. a detailed advance warning designed to scare Japan into surrender was also rejected. Given Japan’s tenacious fighting in the Pacific, the Americans believed that only massive devastation or a successful invasion would lead Japan’s military leadership to surrender. after all, the deaths of more than 100,000 Japanese civilians in the U.S. firebombing of Tokyo and other cities in the spring of 1945 had brought Japan no closer to surrender. In any event, the atomic bombs achieved the immediate goal. The deaths of 100,000 people at Hiroshima and 60,000 at Nagasaki prompted the Japanese government to surrender unconditionally on august 10 and to sign a formal agreement on September 2, 1945. Fascism had been defeated, thanks to a fragile alliance between the capitalist nations of the West and the communist government of the Soviet Union. The coming of peace would strain and then destroy the victorious coalition. even as the global war came to an end, the early signs of the coming Cold War were apparent, as were the stirrings of independence in the European colonies.

Of the city’s 350,000 inhabitants, 190,000 died—some immediately and others after suffering the effects of radiation. Three days later, a second bomb was dropped on the city of Nagasaki.

Glencoe World History 1st Edition,978-0078799815,Jackson J. Spielvogel,Mcgraw-Hill Education,High School,"The war in Asia continued. Beginning in 1943, U.S. forces had gone on the offensive and advanced, slowly at times, across the Pacific. As Allied military power drew closer to the main Japanese islands in the first months of 1945, Harry S Truman, who had become president after the death of Roosevelt in April, had a difficult decision to make. Should he use newly developed atomic weapons to bring the war to an end or find another way to defeat the Japanese forces? Using atomic weapons would, Truman hoped, enable the United States to avoid an invasion of Japan. The Japanese had made extensive preparations to defend their homeland. Truman and his advisers had become convinced that American troops would suffer heavy casualties if they invaded Japan. At the time, however, only two bombs were available, and no one knew how effective they would be. Truman decided to use the bombs. The first bomb was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6. Three days later, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Both cities were leveled. Thousands of people died immediately after the bombs were dropped. Thousands more died in later months from radiation. Japan surrendered on August 14. World War II was finally over. Seventeen million had died in battle. Perhaps twenty million civilians had perished as well. Some estimates place total losses at fifty million."

Naylor, Dahia Ibo Shabaka",Mcdougal Littell,High School,"The Japanese Surrender After Okinawa, the next stop for the Allies had to be Japan. President Truman’s advisers had informed him that an invasion of the Japanese homeland might cost the Allies half a million lives. Truman had to make a decision whether to use a powerful new weapon called the atomic bomb, or A-bomb. Most of his advisers felt that using it would bring the war to the quickest possible end. The bomb had been developed by the top-secret Manhattan Project, headed by General Leslie Groves and chief scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Truman first learned of the new bomb’s existence when he became president. The first atomic bomb was exploded in a desert in New Mexico on July 16, 1945. President Truman then warned the Japanese. He told them that unless they surrendered, they could expect a “rain of ruin from the air.” The Japanese did not reply. So, on August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, a Japanese city of nearly 350,000 people. Between 70,000 and 80,000 people died in the attack. Three days later, on August 9, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, a city of 270,000. More than 70,000 people were killed immediately. Radiation fallout from the two explosions killed many more. The Japanese finally surrendered to General Douglas MacArthur on September 2. The ceremony took place aboard the United States battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay. With Japan’s surrender, the war had ended. Now, countries faced the task of rebuilding a war-torn world."
High School United States History 2016 Student Edition Grade 10,9780133306958,Prentice Hall,Savvas Learning Co,High School,"In truth, Truman did not agonize over the decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan. For the President, abstract ethical issues did not outweigh very real American lives and an opportunity to end the war. Later, some critics would condemn Truman’s decision. But in the late summer of 1945, no one close to him did so. On August 6, 1945, U.S. pilots dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. It exploded at 8:15 A.M. One survivor of the blast later recalled the first moments: “After I noticed the flash, white clouds spread over the blue sky. It was amazing. It was as if blue morning- glories had suddenly bloomed up in the sky. . . . Then came the heat wave. It was very, very hot. Even though there was a window glass in front of me, I felt really hot. It was as if I was looking directly into a kitchen oven. “— Isao Kita, Hiroshima Witness. Within two minutes, more than 60,000 of Hiroshima’s 344,000 residents were dead or missing. Over the next three days, Japanese leaders debated whether to surrender or continue to fight. Then, on August 9, two events rocked Japan. First, the Soviet Union declared war against Japan and invaded Japanese-held Manchuria. Next, the United States dropped a second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, killing 35,000 residents."

News of the explosion reached President Harry S. Truman (who had taken offi ce in April on the death of Roosevelt) in Potsdam, Germany, where he was attending a conference of Allied lead-
ers. He issued an ultimatum to the Japanese (signed jointly by the British) demanding that they surrender by August 3 or face complete devastation. The Japanese premier wanted to accept
the Allied demand, but he still could not persuade the military leaders to agree. There was a hint from Tokyo that the government might agree to surrender, in return for a promise that the Japanese could retain their emperor. The American government, fi rmly committed to the idea of “unconditional surren- der,” dismissed those proposals. They were convinced (perhaps correctly) that the moderates who were making the peace overtures did not have the power to deliver them. When the deadline passed with no surrender, Truman ordered the air force to use the new atomic weapons against Japan. Controversy has raged for decades over whether Truman’s decision to use the bomb was justifi ed and what his motives were. (See “Debating the Past,” pp. 728–729.) Some people have argued that the atomic attack was unnecessary, that had the United States agreed to the retention of the emperor (which it ultimately did agree to, in any case), or waited only a few more weeks, the Japanese would have surrendered. Others argue that nothing less than the atomic bombs could have persuaded the hard-line military leaders of Japan to surrender without a costly American invasion. Some critics of the decision, including some of the scientists involved in the Manhattan Project, have argued that whatever the Japanese intentions, the United States, as a matter of morality, should not have used the terrible new weapon. One horrifi ed physicist wrote the president shortly before the attack: “This thing must not be permitted to exist on this earth. We must not be the most hated and feared people in the world.”"
Out of Many: A History of the American People (Volume 2),978-1-292-02773-9,Faragher Buhle Czitrom Armitage,Pearson Education LImited,College,"On August 3, 1945, Japan announced its refusal to surrender. Its military leaders still demanded a fight to the death, and Japanese civilian politicians wanted Allied guarantees that the emperor, considered sacred, would keep his throne. This response the Americans deemed unsatisfactory: they still demanded unconditional surrender, preferably before the Red Army moved against Japan. Three days later, the B-29 bomber nicknamed Enola Gay dropped the five-ton uranium bomb that destroyed the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Instantly, some 40,000 people died; in the following weeks, 100,000 more perished from radiation poisoning or burns. By 1950, the death toll reached 200,000. “This is not war, this is not even murder; this is pure nihilism . . . a crime against God which strikes at the very basis of moral existence.” So wrote the Japanese Nippon Times. In the United States, several leading religious publications echoed this view.The Christian Century judged the use of the bomb as a “moral earthquake” that by comparison made the long-denounced use of poison gas by Germany in World War I utterly insignificant. Albert Einstein, whose physics provided the foundation for the Manhattan Project (but in which he had taken no part), said that the atomic bomb had changed everything— except the nature of man."
America A Narrative History (Brief 12th Edition),978-0-393-54337-7,David Emory Shi,"W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.",College,"The deadline for Japan’s surrender passed, and on August 6, 1945, a B-29 bomber piloted by Colonel Paul Tibbets (the plane was named Enola Gay after Tibbets’s mother) took off at 2 a.m. from the island of Tinian, headed for Hiroshima. At 8:15 a.m., flying at 31,600 feet, the bombardier aboard the Enola Gay released the five-ton, ten-foot-long uranium bomb nicknamed “Little Boy.” Forty-three seconds later, the bomb exploded at an altitude of 1,900 feet, creating a blinding flash of light followed by a fireball towering to 40,000 feet. The tail gunner on the Enola Gay described the scene: “It’s like bubbling molasses down there . . . the mushroom is spreading out . . . fires are springing up everywhere . . . it’s like a peep into hell.” The bomb’s shock wave and firestorm killed some 78,000 people, including thousands of Japanese soldiers and 23 American prisoners of war. By the end of the year, the death toll would reach 140,000, as people died of injuries or radiation poisoning. In addition, the bomb destroyed 76,000 buildings. President Truman was returning from the Potsdam conference when news arrived that the atomic bomb had been dropped. “This is the greatest thing in history!” he repeatedly exclaimed. In the United States, Americans greeted the news with similar joy. “No tears of sympathy will be shed in America for the Japanese people,” the Omaha World-Herald predicted. “Had they possessed a comparable weapon at Pearl Harbor, would they have hesitated to use it?”"
The American Pageant (14th Edition Volume II),978-0-547-16658-2,"David M. Kennedy, Lizabeth Cohen, Thomas A. Bailey",Wadsworth Cengage Learning,College,"With Japan still refusing to surrender, the Potsdam threat was fulfi lled. On August 6, 1945, a lone Ameri-
can bomber dropped one atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima, Japan. In a blinding fl ash of death, fol-
lowed by a funnel-shaped cloud, about 180,000 people were left killed, wounded, or missing. Some 70,000 of
them died instantaneously. Sixty thousand more soon perished from burns and radiation disease."
Give Me Libery! An American History,978-0-393-61565-4,Eric Foner,"W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.",College,"On August 6, 1945, an American plane dropped an atomic bomb that detonated over Hiroshima, Japan—a target chosen because almost alone among major Japanese cities, it had not yet suffered damage. In an instant, nearly every building in the city was destroyed. Of the city’s population of 280,000 civilians and 40,000 soldiers, approximately 70,000 died immediately. Because atomic bombs release deadly radiation, the death toll kept rising in the months that followed. By the end of the year, it reached at least 140,000. Thousands more perished over the next five years. On August 9, the United States exploded a second bomb over Nagasaki, killing 70,000 persons. On the same day, the Soviet Union declaredwar on Japan and invaded Manchuria. Within a week, Japan surrendered. Because of the enormous cost in civilian lives—more than twice America’s military fatalities in the entire Pacific war—the use of the bomb remains controversial. The Japanese had fought ferociously while being driven from one Pacific island after another. An American invasion of Japan, some advisers warned Truman, might cost as many as 250,000 American lives. No such invasion was planned, however, until the following year, and considerable evi- dence had accumulated that Japan was nearing surrender. Already some of its officials had communicated a willingness to end the war if Emperor Hirohito
could remain on his throne. This fell short of the Allies’ demand for “unconditional surrender,” but the victors would, in the end, agree to Hirohito’s survival. Japan’s economy had been crippled and its fleet destroyed, and it would now have to fight the Soviet Union as well as the United States. Some of the scientists who had worked on the bomb urged Truman to demonstrate its power to international observers. But Truman did not hesitate. The bomb was a weapon, he reasoned, and weapons are created to be used."
The End of World War II in the Pacific,,Charles River Editors,,,"With the detonation of “Little Boy,” the destruction of Hiroshima was far
from “little.” Japanese officials estimated that approximately 70% of the
city's buildings were completely destroyed and another 5-10% were
severely damaged. 80,000 people were killed instantly, and another 70,000
severely injured. The entire world had witnessed the devastation of the
world's most powerful weapon."

A huge mushroom cloud rose above the city. Survivors sitting down for breakfast or preparing to go to school recalled seeing a bright light and then being blown across the room. The immense heat of the blast melted stone and metal, and ignited fires throughout the city. One man later recalled watching his mother and brother burn to death as fire consumed their home. A female survivor, a child at the time of the attack, remembered finding the body of her mother, which had been reduced to ashes and fell apart as she touched it. Two-thirds of the buildings in Hiroshima were destroyed. Within an hour after the bombing, radioactive “black rain” began to fall. Approximately seventy thousand people died in the original blast. The same number would later die of radiation poisoning. When Japan refused to surrender, a second atomic bomb, named Fat Man, was dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. At least sixty thousand people were killed at Nagasaki. Kokura, the primary target, had been shrouded in clouds on that morning and thus had escaped destruction. It is impossible to say with certainty how many died in the two attacks; the heat of the bomb blasts incinerated or vaporized many of the victims"
