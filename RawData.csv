Extremely heavy casualties were feared. By this time, however, the United States had developed a frightfully destructive new weapon. The top-secret Manhattan Project under General Leslie Groves employed over 100,000 people and spent $2 billion to develop a weapon whose power came from the splitting of the atom. J. Robert Oppenheimer, director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, New Mexico, successfully tested the first atomic bomb on July 16, 1945. The new president, Harry Truman, and his wartime allies called on Japan to surrender unconditionally or face “utter destruction.” When Japan gave an unsatisfactory reply, Truman consulted with his advisers and decided to use the new weapon on two Japanese cities. On August 6, an A-bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and on August 9, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. About 250,000 Japanese died, either immediately or after a prolonged period of suffering, as a result of the two nuclear bombs. War and Morality Nuclear weapons, by design, destroyed a much larger area than conventional weapons. When used on population centers, the new technology would cause tens or hundreds of thousands of deaths and injuries from the blast and radiation. The moral issue of killing civilians was raised in World War I by the German use of submarines against passenger ships. In World War II, the Germans and British bombed each other’s cities based on the rationale that it would force the other side to sue for peace. Instead, research after the war concluded it did not have the desired effect. In fact, industrial output often went up because the bombing of urban centers released workers from their commercial jobs to work in well-hidden war plants. Some would argue that in modern industrialized societies, civilians were part of the war effort and therefore legitimate targets. The United States in World War II first used “strategic bombing” of only military targets; however, it began to cross the line with the fire-bombing of Japanese cities, which caused thousands of civilian deaths. Today, people recognize that large-scale nuclear warfare could end most human life, if not most life of all kinds, on Earth. Japan Surrenders Within a week after the second atomic bomb fell, Japan agreed to surrender if the Allies would allow the emperor to remain as a titular (powerless) head of state. General MacArthur received Japan’s formal surrender on September 2, 1945, in Tokyo’s harbor aboard the battleship USS Missouri. The diplomacy that led to the end of the war set the stage for the efforts to construct a more lasting peace (see Topic 7.14). "
"America's History, Volume 2: Since 1865",978-1-4576-2817-7,"James A. Henretta, Eric Hinderaker, Rebecca Edwards, Robert O. Self",Bedford/St. Martin's,High School,"Three weeks later, President Truman ordered the dropping of atomic bombs on two Japanese cities: Hiroshima on august 6 and Nagasaki on august 9. Truman’s rationale for this order—and the implications of his decision—have long been the subject of scholarly and popular debate. The principal reason was straightforward: Truman and his American advisors, including Secretary of War Henry Stimson and army Chief of Staff General George Marshall, believed that Japan’s military leaders would never surrender unless their country faced national ruin. Moreover, at the Potsdam Conference on the outskirts of Berlin in July 1945, the allies had agreed that only the “unconditional surrender” of Japan was acceptable — the same terms under which Germany and Italy had been defeated. To win such a surrender, an invasion of Japan itself seemed necessary. Stimson and Marshall told Truman that such an invasion would produce between half a million and a million allied casualties. Before giving the order to drop the atomic bomb, Truman considered other options. His military advisors rejected the most obvious alternative: a nonlethal demonstration of the bomb’s awesome power, perhaps on a remote Pacific island. If the demonstration failed — not out of the question, as the bomb had been tested only once — it would embolden Japan further. a detailed advance warning designed to scare Japan into surrender was also rejected. Given Japan’s tenacious fighting in the Pacific, the Americans believed that only massive devastation or a successful invasion would lead Japan’s military leadership to surrender. after all, the deaths of more than 100,000 Japanese civilians in the U.S. firebombing of Tokyo and other cities in the spring of 1945 had brought Japan no closer to surrender. In any event, the atomic bombs achieved the immediate goal. The deaths of 100,000 people at Hiroshima and 60,000 at Nagasaki prompted the Japanese government to surrender unconditionally on august 10 and to sign a formal agreement on September 2, 1945. Fascism had been defeated, thanks to a fragile alliance between the capitalist nations of the West and the communist government of the Soviet Union. The coming of peace would strain and then destroy the victorious coalition. even as the global war came to an end, the early signs of the coming Cold War were apparent, as were the stirrings of independence in the European colonies.

Glencoe World History 1st Edition,978-0078799815,Jackson J. Spielvogel,McGraw Hill Education,High School,"The war in Asia continued. Beginning in 1943, U.S. forces had gone on the offensive and advanced, slowly at times, across the Pacific. As Allied military power drew closer to the main Japanese islands in the first months of 1945, Harry S Truman, who had become president after the death of Roosevelt in April, had a difficult decision to make. Should he use newly developed atomic weapons to bring the war to an end or find another way to defeat the Japanese forces? Using atomic weapons would, Truman hoped, enable the United States to avoid an invasion of Japan. The Japanese had made extensive preparations to defend their homeland. Truman and his advisers had become convinced that American troops would suffer heavy casualties if they invaded Japan. At the time, however, only two bombs were available, and no one knew how effective they would be. Truman decided to use the bombs. The first bomb was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6. Three days later, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Both cities were leveled. Thousands of people died immediately after the bombs were dropped. Thousands more died in later months from radiation. Japan surrendered on August 14. World War II was finally over. Seventeen million had died in battle. Perhaps twenty million civilians had perished as well. Some estimates place total losses at fifty million."

Naylor, Dahia Ibo Shabaka",Mcdougal Littell,High School,"The Japanese Surrender After Okinawa, the next stop for the Allies had to be Japan. President Truman’s advisers had informed him that an invasion of the Japanese homeland might cost the Allies half a million lives. Truman had to make a decision whether to use a powerful new weapon called the atomic bomb, or A-bomb. Most of his advisers felt that using it would bring the war to the quickest possible end. The bomb had been developed by the top-secret Manhattan Project, headed by General Leslie Groves and chief scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Truman first learned of the new bomb’s existence when he became president. The first atomic bomb was exploded in a desert in New Mexico on July 16, 1945. President Truman then warned the Japanese. He told them that unless they surrendered, they could expect a “rain of ruin from the air.” The Japanese did not reply. So, on August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, a Japanese city of nearly 350,000 people. Between 70,000 and 80,000 people died in the attack. Three days later, on August 9, a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, a city of 270,000. More than 70,000 people were killed immediately. Radiation fallout from the two explosions killed many more. The Japanese finally surrendered to General Douglas MacArthur on September 2. The ceremony took place aboard the United States battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay. With Japan’s surrender, the war had ended. Now, countries faced the task of rebuilding a war-torn world."

For the President, abstract ethical issues did not outweigh very real American lives and an opportunity to end the war. Later, some critics would condemn Truman’s decision. But in the late summer of 1945, no one close to him did so. On August 6, 1945, U.S. pilots dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. It exploded at 8:15 A.M. One survivor of the blast later recalled the first moments: “After I noticed the flash, white clouds spread over the blue sky. It was amazing. It was as if blue morning- glories had suddenly bloomed up in the sky. . . . Then came the heat wave. It was very, very hot. Even though there was a window glass in front of me, I felt really hot. It was as if I was looking directly into a kitchen oven. “— Isao Kita, Hiroshima Witness. Within two minutes, more than 60,000 of Hiroshima’s 344,000 residents were dead or missing. Over the next three days, Japanese leaders debated whether to surrender or continue to fight. Then, on August 9, two events rocked Japan. First, the Soviet Union declared war against Japan and invaded Japanese-held Manchuria. Next, the United States dropped a second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, killing 35,000 residents."

News of the explosion reached President Harry S. Truman (who had taken offi ce in April on the death of Roosevelt) in Potsdam, Germany, where he was attending a conference of Allied lead-
ers. He issued an ultimatum to the Japanese (signed jointly by the British) demanding that they surrender by August 3 or face complete devastation. The Japanese premier wanted to accept
the Allied demand, but he still could not persuade the military leaders to agree. There was a hint from Tokyo that the government might agree to surrender, in return for a promise that the Japanese could retain their emperor. The American government, fi rmly committed to the idea of “unconditional surren- der,” dismissed those proposals. They were convinced (perhaps correctly) that the moderates who were making the peace overtures did not have the power to deliver them. When the deadline passed with no surrender, Truman ordered the air force to use the new atomic weapons against Japan. Controversy has raged for decades over whether Truman’s decision to use the bomb was justifi ed and what his motives were. (See “Debating the Past,” pp. 728–729.) Some people have argued that the atomic attack was unnecessary, that had the United States agreed to the retention of the emperor (which it ultimately did agree to, in any case), or waited only a few more weeks, the Japanese would have surrendered. Others argue that nothing less than the atomic bombs could have persuaded the hard-line military leaders of Japan to surrender without a costly American invasion. Some critics of the decision, including some of the scientists involved in the Manhattan Project, have argued that whatever the Japanese intentions, the United States, as a matter of morality, should not have used the terrible new weapon. One horrifi ed physicist wrote the president shortly before the attack: “This thing must not be permitted to exist on this earth. We must not be the most hated and feared people in the world.”"
Out of Many: A History of the American People (Volume 2),978-1-292-02773-9,Faragher Buhle Czitrom Armitage,Pearson Education LImited,College,"On August 3, 1945, Japan announced its refusal to surrender. Its military leaders still demanded a fight to the death, and Japanese civilian politicians wanted Allied guarantees that the emperor, considered sacred, would keep his throne. This response the Americans deemed unsatisfactory: they still demanded unconditional surrender, preferably before the Red Army moved against Japan. Three days later, the B-29 bomber nicknamed Enola Gay dropped the five-ton uranium bomb that destroyed the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Instantly, some 40,000 people died; in the following weeks, 100,000 more perished from radiation poisoning or burns. By 1950, the death toll reached 200,000. “This is not war, this is not even murder; this is pure nihilism . . . a crime against God which strikes at the very basis of moral existence.” So wrote the Japanese Nippon Times. In the United States, several leading religious publications echoed this view.The Christian Century judged the use of the bomb as a “moral earthquake” that by comparison made the long-denounced use of poison gas by Germany in World War I utterly insignificant. Albert Einstein, whose physics provided the foundation for the Manhattan Project (but in which he had taken no part), said that the atomic bomb had changed everything— except the nature of man."

Norton & Company, Inc.",College,"The deadline for Japan’s surrender passed, and on August 6, 1945, a B-29 bomber piloted by Colonel Paul Tibbets (the plane was named Enola Gay after Tibbets’s mother) took off at 2 a.m. from the island of Tinian, headed for Hiroshima. At 8:15 a.m., flying at 31,600 feet, the bombardier aboard the Enola Gay released the five-ton, ten-foot-long uranium bomb nicknamed “Little Boy.” Forty-three seconds later, the bomb exploded at an altitude of 1,900 feet, creating a blinding flash of light followed by a fireball towering to 40,000 feet. The tail gunner on the Enola Gay described the scene: “It’s like bubbling molasses down there . . . the mushroom is spreading out . . . fires are springing up everywhere . . . it’s like a peep into hell.” The bomb’s shock wave and firestorm killed some 78,000 people, including thousands of Japanese soldiers and 23 American prisoners of war. By the end of the year, the death toll would reach 140,000, as people died of injuries or radiation poisoning. In addition, the bomb destroyed 76,000 buildings. President Truman was returning from the Potsdam conference when news arrived that the atomic bomb had been dropped. “This is the greatest thing in history!” he repeatedly exclaimed. In the United States, Americans greeted the news with similar joy. “No tears of sympathy will be shed in America for the Japanese people,” the Omaha World-Herald predicted. “Had they possessed a comparable weapon at Pearl Harbor, would they have hesitated to use it?”"

Give Me Libery! An American History,978-0-393-61565-4,Eric Foner,"W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.",College,"On August 6, 1945, an American plane dropped an atomic bomb that detonated over Hiroshima, Japan—a target chosen because almost alone among major Japanese cities, it had not yet suffered damage. In an instant, nearly every building in the city was destroyed. Of the city’s population of 280,000 civilians and 40,000 soldiers, approximately 70,000 died immediately. Because atomic bombs release deadly radiation, the death toll kept rising in the months that followed. By the end of the year, it reached at least 140,000. Thousands more perished over the next five years. On August 9, the United States exploded a second bomb over Nagasaki, killing 70,000 persons. On the same day, the Soviet Union declaredwar on Japan and invaded Manchuria. Within a week, Japan surrendered. Because of the enormous cost in civilian lives—more than twice America’s military fatalities in the entire Pacific war—the use of the bomb remains controversial. The Japanese had fought ferociously while being driven from one Pacific island after another. An American invasion of Japan, some advisers warned Truman, might cost as many as 250,000 American lives. No such invasion was planned, however, until the following year, and considerable evi- dence had accumulated that Japan was nearing surrender. Already some of its officials had communicated a willingness to end the war if Emperor Hirohito
could remain on his throne. This fell short of the Allies’ demand for “unconditional surrender,” but the victors would, in the end, agree to Hirohito’s survival. Japan’s economy had been crippled and its fleet destroyed, and it would now have to fight the Soviet Union as well as the United States. Some of the scientists who had worked on the bomb urged Truman to demonstrate its power to international observers. But Truman did not hesitate. The bomb was a weapon, he reasoned, and weapons are created to be used."

A huge mushroom cloud rose above the city. Survivors sitting down for breakfast or preparing to go to school recalled seeing a bright light and then being blown across the room. The immense heat of the blast melted stone and metal, and ignited fires throughout the city. One man later recalled watching his mother and brother burn to death as fire consumed their home. A female survivor, a child at the time of the attack, remembered finding the body of her mother, which had been reduced to ashes and fell apart as she touched it. Two-thirds of the buildings in Hiroshima were destroyed. Within an hour after the bombing, radioactive “black rain” began to fall. Approximately seventy thousand people died in the original blast. The same number would later die of radiation poisoning. When Japan refused to surrender, a second atomic bomb, named Fat Man, was dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. At least sixty thousand people were killed at Nagasaki. Kokura, the primary target, had been shrouded in clouds on that morning and thus had escaped destruction. It is impossible to say with certainty how many died in the two attacks; the heat of the bomb blasts incinerated or vaporized many of the victims"
America: A Narrative History,9780393927337,"George Brown Tindall, David E. Shi","W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.",High School,"By that time, however, President Truman had learned of the first successful test explosion of an atomic bomb, the result of intensive research and development, begun in 1940, when President Roosevelt had set up a committee to study atomic weaponry. Army and navy funds were soon diverted to fund the research that ultimately grew into the $2-billion topsecret Manhattan Project. On December 2, 1942, Dr. Enrico Fermi and other scientists achieved the first atomic chain reaction at the University of Chicago, removing any remaining doubts about the bomb’s feasibility. Gigantic plants sprang up at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington, to provide material for atomic bombs, while a group of physicists under J. Robert Oppenheimer worked out the scientific and technical problems of bomb construction in a laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. On July 16, 1945, the first atomic fireball rose from the desert. Oppenheimer said later that in the observation bunker “a few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.” How to use this awful new weapon posed a profound dilemma. Some scientists favored a demonstration in a remote area, but military use was decided upon because only two bombs were available, and even those might misfire. More consideration was given to the choice of targets. Four Japanese cities were potential targets. Priority went to Hiroshima, a port city of 400,000 people in southern Japan, which was a major assembly point for Japanese naval convoys, a center of war industries, and headquarters of the Second General Army. On July 25, 1945, President Harry S. Truman, who had been thrust into office after Roosevelt’s death in April, ordered the atomic bomb dropped if Japan did not surrender before August 3. Although an intense scholarly debate has emerged over the decision to drop the atomic bomb, it is clear that Truman believed that the bomb was “a military weapon and never had any doubt that it should be used.” He was convinced that the atomic bomb would save lives by avoiding a costly American invasion against defenders who would fight like “savages, ruthless, merciless, and fanatic.” The ferocious Japanese defense of Okinawa had convinced military planners that an amphibious invasion of Japan itself, scheduled to begin on November 1, 1945, could cost as many as 250,000 Allied casualties and even more Japanese losses. Moreover, some 100,000 Allied prisoners of war being held in Japan would most likely be executed when an invasion began. It is important to remember as well that the bombing of cities and the consequent killing 1126 • THE SECOND WORLD WAR (CH. 30) of civilians had become accepted military practice during 1945. Once the Japanese navy was destroyed, American ships had roamed the Japanese coastline, shelling targets onshore. American planes had bombed at will and mined the waters of the Inland Sea. Tokyo, Nagoya, and other major cities had been devastated by firestorms created by incendiary bombs. The firebomb raids on Tokyo on a single night in March 1945 killed over 100,000 civilians and left over 1 million people homeless. By July more than sixty of Japan’s largest cities had been firebombed, resulting in 500,000 deaths and 13 million civilians left homeless. The use of atomic bombs on Japanese cities was thus seen as a logical next step to end the war without an invasion of Japan. As it turned out, American scientists greatly underestimated the physical effects of the atomic bomb. They predicted that 20,000 people would be killed. On July 26 the heads of the American, British, and Russian governments issued the Potsdam Declaration, demanding that Japan surrender or face “prompt and utter destruction.” The deadline passed, and on August 6, 1945, a B-29 bomber named the Enola Gay took off at 2 A.M. from the island of Tinian and headed for Hiroshima. At 8:15 A.M., flying at 31,600 feet, the Enola Gay released the five-ton uranium bomb nicknamed Little Boy. Fortythree seconds later, as the Enola Gay turned sharply to avoid the blast, the bomb tumbled to an altitude of 1,900 feet, where it exploded as planned with the force of 20,000 tons of TNT. A blinding flash of light was followed by a fireball towering to 40,000 feet. The tail gunner on the Enola Gay described the scene: “It’s like bubbling molasses down there . . . the mushroom is spreading out . . . fires are springing up everywhere . . . it’s like a peep into hell.” The shock wave, firestorm, cyclonic winds, and radioactive rain killed some 80,000 people, including thousands of Japanese soldiers assigned to the Second General Army headquarters and 23 American prisoners of war housed in the city. Dazed survivors wandered the streets, so painfully burned that their skin began to peel off in large strips. By the end of the year, the death toll had reached 140,000 as the effects of radiation burns and infection took their toll. In addition, 70,000 buildings were destroyed, and four square miles of the city turned to rubble. In the United States, Americans greeted the first news with elation: the bombing promised a quick end to the long nightmare of war. “No tears of sympathy will be shed in America for the Japanese people,” the Omaha World-Herald predicted. “Had they possessed a comparable weapon at Pearl Harbor, would they have hesitated to use it?” Others were more circumspect. “Yesterday,” the journalist Hanson Baldwin wrote in the New York Times, “we clinched victory in the Pacific, but we sowed the whirlwind.”Two days after the Hiroshima bombing, an opportunistic Soviet Union, eager to share in the spoils of victory, hastened to enter the war in Asia. Truman and his aides, frustrated by the stubborn refusal of Japanese military and political leaders to surrender and fearful that the Soviet Union’s entry into the war would complicate negotiations, ordered the second atomic bomb dropped. On August 9, a B-29 aircraft named Bockscar, carrying a bomb dubbed Fat Man, flew over its primary target, Kokura. However, the city was so shrouded in haze and smoke from an earlier air raid that the plane turned to its secondary target, Nagasaki, where it dropped its bomb at 11:02 A.M., killing 36,000 people. That night the Japanese emperor urged his cabinet to surrender on the sole condition that he remain as sovereign. The next day the U.S. government announced its willingness to let the emperor keep his throne, but under the authority of an Allied supreme commander. Frantic exchanges ended with Japanese acceptance of the terms on August 14, 1945, when the emperor himself broke with precedent to record a radio message announcing the surrender to the public. On September 2, 1945, General Douglas MacArthur and other Allied representatives accepted Japan’s formal surrender on board the battleship Missouri 1128 • THE SECOND WORLD WAR (CH. 30) The Bomb This image shows the wasteland that remained after the atomic bomb “Little Boy” decimated Hiroshima in 1945. in Tokyo Bay.

Three days later, a second bomb, code-named Fat Man, was dropped on Nagasaki, leveling half the city.

"The American Vision, Modern Times",9780078745232,McGraw Hill Education,McGraw Hill Education,High School,"Hiroshima and Nagasaki Even before the bomb was tested, American officials began debating how to use it. Admiral William Leahy, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, opposed using the bomb because it killed civilians indiscriminately. He believed an economic blockade and conventional bombing would convince Japan to surrender. Secretary of War Henry Stimson wanted to warn the Japanese about the bomb while at the same time telling them that they could keep the emperor if they surrendered. Secretary of State James Byrnes, however, wanted to drop the bomb without any warning to shock Japan into surrendering. President Truman later wrote that he “regarded the bomb as a military weapon and never had any doubts that it should be used.” His advisers had warned him to expect massive casualties if the United States invaded Japan. Truman believed it was his duty as president to use every weapon available to save American lives. The Allies threatened Japan with “prompt and utter destruction” if the nation did not surrender, but the Japanese did not reply. Truman then ordered the military to drop the bomb. On August 6, 1945, a B-29 bomber named Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb, code-named “Little Boy,” on Hiroshima, an important industrial city. The bomb destroyed about 63 percent of the city. Between 80,000 and 120,000 people died instantly, and thousands more died later from burns and radiation sickness. Three days later, on August 9, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. Later that day, the United States dropped another atomic bomb, code-named “Fat Man,” on the city of Nagasaki, killing between 35,000 and 74,000 people. Faced with such massive destruction and the shock of the Soviets joining the war, the Japanese emperor ordered his government to surrender. On August 15, 1945—V-J Day— Japan surrendered.

A People’s History of the United States,9780061989834,Howard Zinn,HarperCollins,College,"The enemy, in a military sense, was in a hopeless strategic position by the time the Potsdam demand for unconditional surrender was made on July 26. Such then, was the situation when we wiped out Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Need we have done it? No one can, of course, be positive, but the answer is almost certainly negative. The United States Strategic Bombing Survey, set up by the War Department in 1944 to study the results of aerial attacks in the war, interviewed hundreds of Japanese civilian and military leaders after Japan surrendered, and reported just after the war: Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey’s opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated. But could American leaders have known this in August 1945? The answer is, clearly, yes. The Japanese code had been broken, and Japan’s messages were being intercepted. It was known the Japanese had instructed their ambassador in Moscow to work on peace negotiations with the Allies. Japanese leaders had begun talking of surrender a year before this, and the Emperor himself had begun to suggest, in June 1945, that alternatives to fighting to the end be considered. On July 13, Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo wired his ambassador in Moscow: “Unconditional surrender is the only obstacle to peace. . . .” Martin Sherwin, after an exhaustive study of the relevant historical documents, concludes: “Having broken the Japanese code before the war, American Intelligence was able to—and did—relay this message to the President, but it had no effect whatever on efforts to bring the war to a conclusion.” If only the Americans had not insisted on unconditional surrender—that is, if they were willing to accept one condition to the surrender, that the Emperor, a holy figure to the Japanese, remain in place—the Japanese would have agreed to stop the war.”"
World Civilizations: The Global Experience,9780205659562,Peter N Stearns,Longman,College,"Though impressive in size and the speed with which it was formed, the Japanese empire soon proved highly vulnerable to the Allied forces committed to its destruction. The Japanese had risked alienating virtually all of the European colonial powers by their seizure of much of southeast Asia. They did so because they calculated that since the European metropoles had been overrun or were hard-pressed by the Nazis, the Europeans would not be able to reinforce their colonial enclaves. The Japanese leadership was also aware that their homeland s wartime economy was in desperate need of critical raw materials, including oil and staple foods, that could be imported from southeast Asia. But in their efforts to extract those resources, the Japanese imposed colonial regimes on the peoples of southeast Asia that were a good deal more brutally oppressive than those of any of the displaced Western colonizers. Over time, this produced growing resistance movements from Burma to the Philippines, which drew Japanese soldiers and substantial resources from the war in the Pacific against the advancing Allied forces. Resistance fighters also cooperated with British and American forces pushing into the area in the latter stages of the war. Southeast Asian guerrilla forces, which often had communist affiliations, played significant roles in sabotaging occupying forces and harassing retreating Japanese armies. The shipping lanes from distant colonial enclaves throughout southeast Asia also proved highly vulnerable to American submarines, which by late 1944 were able to sink a high percentage of the tons of foodstuffs and war materials shipped back to Japan. The main front of the Pacific theater of the war centered on the widely scattered islands that Japan had begun to occupy before, and especially after, World War I, as well as those seized from the British and Americans after Pearl Harbor. No sooner had the Japanese garrisoned these enclaves than a hastily but well prepared American advance into the central Pacific put them on the defensive. Having attacked Pearl Harbor when all of the major American aircraft carriers were at sea, the Japanese missed the chance to cripple the most potent weapons in the United States arsenal. Within six months United States naval and air forces fought the Japanese to a standoff at the Battle of the Coral Sea. In June, less than a month later, off Midway Island, they won a decisive victory over a powerful carrier force, commanded by Admiral Yamamoto, the architect of the Pearl Harbor attack. Once the Allied forces had gained the upper hand in the air and on the sea through these engagements, they could begin the assault on the double ring of Pacific island fortresses that protected the Japanese homeland (Figure 35.5). Keying their amphibious assaults on strategically vital islands, the joint air, sea, and land operations of the Allied forces had come within striking distance of Japan itself by early 1944, despite fierce and unrelenting Japanese resistance. In June of that year, the American air force began regular bomber assaults on the Japanese home islands. The high concentration of the Japanese population in urban areas and the wood and paper construction of most Japanese dwellings provided tempting targets for American bomber squadrons. In March 1945, General Curtis Le May, who was in charge of American air operations, ordered mass aerial bombardment of highly vulnerable Japanese cities. In Tokyo alone, these raids killed over 125,000 people, mostly civilians, and destroyed over 40 percent of the city within days. At the same time, Allied naval superiority and submarine attacks had largely cut the home islands off from what remained of the empire in China and southeast Asia. By the early summer of 1945, Japanese leaders were sending out peace feelers, while the more fanatical elements in the army were promising to fight to the death. The end was sudden and terrifying. On August 6 and three days later on August 9, atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively. In moments these cities, which to this point had been spared bombing, were reduced to ashes. Short-term casualties in both cities were well over 100,000, and deaths from radiation sickness increased this total greatly in the years, and even decades, that followed. Even more than in the European theater, the end of the long and most destructive war in human history came swiftly. As they had in dealing with Germany, the Allies demanded unconditional surrender by the Japanese. With the exception of retaining the emperor, which was finally allowed, the Japanese agreed to these terms and began to disarm. With the division of Germany that had begun some months earlier, the Allied occupation of the islands set the stage for the third main phase of the 20th century, which would be dominated by the cold war between the Soviet and American superpowers that would be waged amid the collapse of the European colonial order."
World War II: A Global History,9780367150952,"Michael J. Lyons, David J. Ulbrich",Routledge,College,"The Japanese government’s vague reply led Truman and his advisers to see it as a rejection. The president needed to make his decision between using the atomic bomb and launching an invasion. Many factors fgured into Truman’s thinking. Although he played up his humble background, he possessed a keen enough intellect to grapple with moral ambiguities. He recognized that the American people had wearied of war and wanted a resolution. He knew how bloody an invasion of Japan would be, having seen the worst examples of combat in World War I. Truman knew that the huge expense of developing the atomic bombs would be wasted if he decided on the invasion. Truman could not ignore the emerging threat of Soviet expansion into East Asia. Using the atomic bombs to end the war quickly would forestall negotiations to divvy up that region, possibly with similar results to the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe. The dominant racist view of most Americans made killing more inferior Japanese easier to accept. The Pearl Harbor attack, the Bataan death march, and the brutal combat in the Pacifc must have reduced any ambivalence in measuring the value of American lives versus Japanese lives. Besides, several months of B-29s frebombing dozens of populous Japanese cities already broke the threshold and set precedents for one last air raid. Ultimately, however, the most critical factor was the simplest factor. Harry Truman chose to drop the atomic bombs in the hope of ending the war quickly. He understood that many Japanese would die in these attacks; however, an exponentially greater number of American and Japanese lives would be saved in the long run. The American leaders decided to go forward with plans to drop an atomic bomb on a major Japanese city. Major General Groves left no doubts about the reasoning when he afrmed the decision: “I had set as the governing factor that the targets chosen should be places the bombing of which would most adversely afect the will of the Japanese people to continue the war.”6 America compiled a list of the handful of major urban centers that had escaped frebombing. Such an unspoiled target would provide a dramatic demonstration of the bomb’s terrible power. The leading candidate was Hiroshima, a city of 340,000 people located on the southeastern coast of Honshu, Japan’s principal island. The bombing mission would occur in early August. The B-29, named Enola Gay after the pilot’s mother, lifted of the runway on Tinian early in the morning of August 6. It carried a 9,000-pound atomic bomb, dubbed “Little Boy,” with the destructive power of 13 kilotons or the equivalent of 13,000 tons of TNT. The weather over Hiroshima remained ideal as Enola Gay approached. Shortly before 8:15 am, the ungainly atomic bomb fell out of the plane’s bomb bay doors. When it reached a point 660 yards from the ground, a blinding fash illuminated the sky, and then a gigantic freball burst over the city. Shock waves of unbelievable force followed, leveling almost everything in their path. The unearthly sight inspired Enola Gay’s copilot to enter a terse, “My God!” in his logbook. A tower of purple, orange, gray, and black smoke swirled upward, topped by a cloud in the shape of a mushroom. It ultimately reached an altitude of 55,000 feet. More than half of Hiroshima virtually disappeared. Some 80,000 Japanese people died instantly. Many more perished in the following days, weeks, and years from severe burns and the harmful efects of radiation. Forcing Japan’s Surrender Later that day, Truman warned the Japanese that, unless they surrendered, more cities would experience the same horror. Japan’s government reacted to the disaster by stepping up its unrealistic eforts to persuade the Soviet Union to help arrange a peace. Stalin responded on August 8 by declaring war on Japan, just as he promised at Yalta, albeit three months after Germany’s surrender. The Soviet Army already massed 1.5 million men along the Manchurian border for months. Japan’s once-formidable Kwantung Army defending Manchukuo (Manchuria) had watched as much of its strength siphoned of to bolster the defense of Japan and other fronts. Three Soviet armies under Marshal Alexander Vasilevsky knifed swiftly into Manchuria from both east and west. Secretary of War Stimson was troubled by the horror of the Hiroshima cataclysm and urged Truman to make a peace overture to Japan. But the president determined to stand on the Potsdam Declaration. If the Japanese did not agree to surrender, they would experience a second atomic bomb nicknamed “Fat Man.” On August 9, the Americans targeted Nagasaki, a city of 250,000 on Kyushu’s western coast. Although more powerful than the frst, the second atomic blast produced less spectacular results. The explosion fattened Nagasaki’s center and killed 35,000 people, but the surrounding hills limited the efects of the freball, shockwave, and radiation. The combination of the two atomic bombs and the Soviet Union’s entry into the war convinced most senior Japanese leaders that they had no choice but to surrender. In fact, the Supreme War Council had debated acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration even before the second bomb struck Nagasaki. However, the six-member council remained split, despite learning about Nagasaki. Three members, including Prime Minister Suzuki, wanted to accept the declaration, but the other three, led by War Minister and General Korechika Anami, voiced intense opposition. Emperor Hirohito broke precedent and the deadlock one day after the Nagasaki disaster by personally requesting that the council and the government consent to the declaration with the sole proviso that the emperor should retain his position. On August 10, the government relayed its acceptance on this basis. "
